- Objects and arrays  
- Error handling (`try-catch`)  
- ES6+ features:
  - Template literals
  - Destructuring
  - Spread/rest operators
  - Promises and `async/await`

### 2. Node.js Basics

- What is Node.js? (Event-driven, non-blocking I/O)
- Installing Node.js and npm
- Running JavaScript files with Node.js
- Modules:
  - CommonJS (`require`, `module.exports`)
  - ES Modules (`import`, `export`)
- Core modules:
  - `fs` (file system)
  - `path`
  - `http`  
    - Introduction to HTTP  
    - Basic HTTP server (`req`, `res`, `writeHead`)  
    - HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH …)  
    - Working with status codes  
    - Working with headers  
    - Handling POST data  
    - Serving static files (txt, html) & server-side rendering  
    - HTTP client  
    - Security and CORS  
    - Comparison with Express
- Event loop and asynchronous programming
- Working with `package.json` and npm

### 3. Express.js Basics

- What is Express.js? (Minimalist web framework for Node.js)
- Setting up an Express application
- Routing (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Middleware (built-in, custom, third-party)
- Handling requests and responses
- Serving static files
- Basic error handling

### 4. MongoDB Basics

- What is MongoDB? (NoSQL database)
- Installing MongoDB locally or using a cloud service (MongoDB Atlas)
- Core concepts:
  - Databases, collections, and documents
  - CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Using MongoDB Shell or Compass
- Connecting Node.js to MongoDB using the native driver

### 5. Tools and Environment

- Version control with Git and GitHub
- Basic command-line usage
- Using a code editor (e.g., VS Code)

---

## Intermediate Level: Building Real Applications

Apply your knowledge to build functional backend systems and deepen your understanding.

### 6. Advanced JavaScript and Node.js

- Closures and scope
- Event emitters in Node.js
- Streams and buffers
- Working with child processes
- Debugging Node.js applications
- Performance optimization basics

### 7. Express.js Intermediate

- RESTful API design principles
- Request validation (`express-validator`)
- Environment variables (`dotenv`)
- Authentication middleware (JWT with `jsonwebtoken`)
- File uploads (`multer`)
- Templating engines (optional: EJS or Pug)

### 8. MongoDB Intermediate

- Mongoose (MongoDB ODM):
  - Schemas and models
  - Validation
  - Middleware (pre/post hooks)
- Querying:
  - Filters, sorting, and pagination
  - Aggregation pipeline basics
- Relationships in MongoDB (embedding vs. referencing)
- Indexes for performance

### 9. Building a Full Backend

- Structuring a Node.js/Express project (MVC pattern, folder structure)
- CRUD API with Express and MongoDB
- Error handling across the application
- Logging (`winston`, `morgan`)

### 10. Testing Basics

- Testing APIs with `supertest`
- Unit testing with `Jest` or `Mocha`
- Mocking MongoDB with `mongodb-memory-server`

## Advanced Level: Senior Developer Skills

Focus on scalability, security, and advanced tools to handle complex, production-grade systems.

### 11. Advanced Node.js

- Worker threads for CPU-intensive tasks
- Cluster module for multi-core scaling
- Memory management and profiling
- Building CLI tools with Node.js
- Custom module creation and publishing to npm

### 12. Advanced Express.js

- Rate limiting (`express-rate-limit`)
- Caching strategies (Redis with `redis` package)
- WebSockets with `socket.io` for real-time apps
- Microservices architecture basics
- Middleware optimization

### 13. Advanced MongoDB

- Advanced aggregation pipelines

- Load balancing and reverse proxies (Nginx)
- Monitoring and logging in production (New Relic, ELK stack)

### 16. Performance Optimization

- Profiling Node.js with `clinic.js` or built-in tools
- Database optimization (query performance, indexing)
- Caching with Redis or in-memory stores
- Lazy loading and pagination
- Horizontal scaling strategies

### 17. Advanced Testing

- Integration testing
- End-to-end (E2E) testing
- Test-driven development (TDD)
- Mocking external services
- Load testing (`Artillery`, `k6`)

### 18. Additional Tools and Concepts
