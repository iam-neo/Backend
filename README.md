## About

This programme prepares learners for backend development roles by combining theory, practical labs, and full-stack project work. It focuses on building scalable, secure, and maintainable server-side applications.

---

## Who is this for

- Beginners with basic programming knowledge
- Frontend developers shifting towards backend
- Students and professionals preparing for backend job roles

---

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of programming (preferably JavaScript or Python)
- Familiarity with Git and the command line
- Basic HTTP / web concepts

---

## Learning Goals

By the end of the programme you will be able to:

- Design and implement RESTful APIs
- Work with relational and NoSQL databases
- Implement authentication and authorization
- Write unit and integration tests for backend code
- Containerize apps with Docker and deploy to cloud
- Understand performance, caching, and horizontal scaling basics

---
